Welcome to Quiz_App's documentation!
====================================

Create an application which meets the following requirements:

A teacher of a year 10 math class would like a simple application which gives them the ability to test pupils using multiple choice questions, and also have the ability to determine the pass or fail rate for those that take the tests. The application should allow for pupils to register and take the created test questions, following on from the registration process. Once a pupil has taken the test, that pupil should be notified of whether they have passed or failed. When pupils have taken the tests, the teacher should have the ability to see all pupils and their related test scores, in one single location.

The application should provide the following:

For teachers:

    The ability to add multiple choice questions, of varying difficulties, with 3 possible solutions and potentially multiple possible answers
    The ability to define a pass/fail percentage for pupils taking the tests
    The ability to view all pupils that have taken the tests and their respective scores

For Pupils:

    The ability to register to take a test, with at least the following details:
        First Name
        Surname
        Email address
    The ability to take a test
    The ability to receive a notification of whether they have passed or failed
